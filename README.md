# HVboom Portfolio

This plugin based on a [BootstrapWP tutorial](http://bootstrapwp.com/portfolio-custom-post-type-tutorial/) to create a custom post type.

The implementation based on a Github project [WP Custom Post Type Class](https://github.com/jjgrainger/wp-custom-post-type-class) to simplify the definition of a custom post type.
This project has to be installed in a _vendor_ subdirectory.

The structure of the generated HTML code is reflected in the stylesheet (see `assets/stylesheets/hvboom-portfolio.css`). By the way this CSS file is generated based on the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) file located in `assets/stylesheets/sass`.

To include the portfolio into your Wordpress page just use the shortcode `[hvboom-portfolio]` to get a listing of all defined portfolios.
